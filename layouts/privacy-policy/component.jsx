            <p>
              European Economic Area (“EEA”) data protection laws offer
              additional rights and protections for individuals located in the
              EEA. Further to the information set out at the ‘
              <a href="#information-access-deletion">Personal information access and deletion</a>’ section of this
              Privacy Policy, the following additional information applies to
              you if you are located in the EEA:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Basis of processing:</b> Where you make a donation to WRI and
                give us your personal information to receive communications
                related to your donation, we process your personal information
                based on your consent. Likewise, when we collect device location
                data from a TerraMatch user&apos;s device in order to map a
                planting project, we do so only with your consent. When you have
                made a past donation and have not objected to marketing
                communications, and we send you information about how you can
                continue to support WRI, we process your personal information
                based on legitimate interest. Where you give us your personal
                information for any other reason, we process your personal
                information for our legitimate business purposes to respond to
                your requests (for example, providing you with access to our
                websites or providing you with newsletter communications that
                you have requested);
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Personal information rights:</b> In addition to your right to
                access personal information we hold about you (as set out at the
                ‘<a href="#information-access-deletion">Personal information access and deletion</a>‘{" "}
                section of
                this Privacy Policy), you have the right to have your personal
                information rectified or erased, to object to its processing or
                to restrict access to it. You also have the right to lodge a
                complaint with your local data protection authority if you are
                unhappy with how we process your personal information. In
                certain circumstances, you may also have the right to receive a
                copy of your personal information in a machine-readable format
                or to have your personal information sent to another company.
